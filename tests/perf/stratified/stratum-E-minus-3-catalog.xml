    <tc:p>A collection of tests which (at the outset of an effort to
    improve performance) run in less than ten milliseconds.</tc:p>

    <tc:p>This test collection is empty:  in the results I'm working
    from, no tests ran (both grammar and instance) in less than ten
    milliseconds.  Sigh.</tc:p>
