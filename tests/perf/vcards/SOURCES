# Toy samples:

  * in/example-01.vcf (single card) via email from Dave Pawson in
    June.

  * in/example-02.vcf from https://github.com/ertant/vCard

  * in/example-03.vcf from Eliot Kimber's email to xsl-list

  * examples-from-rfc.vcf from
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6350 (extracted manually)

# Real-data samples:

All received via email from the owners on 11 August.

Do not redistribute, destroy when done.  If possible without affecting
performance, use the fuzzed versions.

  * EQ.contacts.{xml,fuzzed.xml)

  * OX.contacts.{xml,fuzzed.xml} 
  
  * UV.contacts.{xml,fuzzed.xml} 

The fuzzing of the real data was performed using
Aparecium/tests/perf/lib/fuzz-vcf.xq (that should leave the size
unchanged; it's not clear why the size is different).
