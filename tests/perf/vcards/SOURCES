# Toy samples:

  * DaveP.vcf (single card) via email in June.

  * ertant.vcf from https://github.com/ertant/vCard

  * examples-from-rfc.vcf from
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6350 (extracted manually)

  * kimber.vcf from Eliot Kimber's email to xsl-list

# Real-data samples:

All received via email from the owners on 11 August.

Do not redistribute, destroy when done.  If possible without affecting
performance, use the fuzzed versions.

  * DP.contacts.{xml,fuzzed.xml) from Dave Pawson 

  * NormContacts.{xml,fuzzed.xml} from Norm Walsh
  
  * BTU-Addresses-20220811.{xml,fuzzed.xml} from Tommie Usdin

The fuzzing of the real data was performed using
Aparecium/tests/perf/lib/fuzz-vcf.xq (that should leave the size
unchanged; it's not clear why the size is different).
